Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

This repo contains all the SQL code that I've written during basics of database management course (bazy danych 1) at the university.
In some files there are whole tasks in others only solutions.

All the queries are for the database which you can create using `restore_database.sql`.

Tasks are in Polish.

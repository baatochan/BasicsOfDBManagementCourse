This repo contains all the SQL code that I wrote during Basics of Database Management course (bazy danych 1) at the university.

In some files there are whole tasks; in others only solutions.

All the queries are for the database which you can create using `restore_database.sql` in Oracle SQL.

Tasks are in Polish.
